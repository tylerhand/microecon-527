# Microeconomics 527
***
This repository is for items related to the 527 course. To view work for the problem sets, please navigate to the "problem-sets" folder.

Here are some resources if needed (for Python):

### Markdown:
- [Markdown Reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Markdown Reference - Github Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)

### Python:

You can learn Python for free on [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/)

Here is what you will need for this class (so far, I think):
- [Hello, World!](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
- [Variables and Types](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types)
- [Basic Operators](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_Operators)

### Jupyter Notebooks (Python for data science):

- [Jupyter Notebooks - jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)

Personally, I pay for [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce). If you want an IDE (integrated development environment) for free, you can use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

If you don't want to deal with installing anything on your computer, you can use the online (web) version on juypter.org.
